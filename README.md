This is a simple blog template for Blended.

To use, download all of these files into the 'templates' folder of your Blended website.

The *About Me* section is based off of whatever you have {website_description_long} set to in your config.py file.

If you want to add a post image, it must be a JPG (.jpg) and is must have the same name as the post file ex. `getting-started.jpg`. Also, it must be placed in the `templates/assets/img/` folder.
